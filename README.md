# Toy Origami Bot Insect (TOBI)

This repo details all of the supplementary files for a final-year engineering project.

## Description

Origami is an art form that folds paper into various shapes. These can range from a simple
butterfly to very many complicated patterns such as an intricate dragon. This idea has inspired
an engineering manufacturing technique, where the frame of a robot or other mechanical parts
are made to be assembled from a two-dimensional sheet to a three-dimensional pattern. This
allows for a more cost-effective manufacturing process and allows for easier storage and assembly
of the design. Translating the idea of folding paper to more robust objects can prove difficult
due to the complicated nature of the designs and the specialist equipment often required to
build these origami materials so this process is what the project aims to solve. This will be
done by designing a frame for a legged robot that will be used to entertain a cat. The robot
will need to be able to autonomously navigate a house while avoiding any obstacles in it.

A picture of the final robot made from the closed hardboard frame is found below.

## Contents
### Software

This contains the code used on the ESP32 on the robot to use the object avoidance. It also contains the code used to create a curve of defined curve segments.

### Hardware

This file contains the budget to see all components as well all the .stl files of the whegs and each frame. This can be exported to pdfs to cut them.
